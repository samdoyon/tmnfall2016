color: #333">IN THIS NEW SINGLE-PLAYER SIMULATION,</strong> students learn how to use one of the most popular market research methods: conjoint analysis. Through 2 different exercisesâone set in the âgreen carâ segment of the auto industry, and another in the health care marketplaceâthis simulation shows students how conjoint analysis output is relevant in practice. It also provides an interactive experience of using conjoint analysis for managerial decision making.</p>			 <p>This simulation gives students concrete exposure to key business concepts such as demand curves, segmentation, profit functions, competitive responses, vertical and horizontal differentiation, optimal pricing, niche vs. mass market strategies, product portfolio management, and brand equity.</p>			<p>During the 2 exercises, students workâas product managerâon a series of goals and face a host of competitive settings. To inform their decisions, students have access to results of a conjoint analysis study. They can view these results in various ways and can run market simulations under multiple conditions to learn various data points, such as forecasted demand in units or sales revenue at different price points. </p>			<h5>Playing the simulation</h5>		<p>In both the âgreen carâ and health care exercises, students can be given a variety of business goals to achieve. Students will need to consider new market conditions when completing each goal, including new business objectives, changing competition, and a varied set of constraints.</p> 		<p>After each business goal is presented in detail, students are given the following steps to complete each goal:</p>		<ol>		<li>Review the conjoint output. (Videos are provided to aid the students in their analysis of the data.)</li>		<li>Review the product(s) in the marketplace.</li>		<li>Select attribute levels for the proposed product and run the market choice predictor to see how the product will perform in the marketplace.</li><li>Submit a solution or run another simulation.</li></ol><p>When students run a simulation, the market choice predictor uses the conjoint data to determine the commercial performance of each product in the market, including the product configured in the simulator. </p><p>Once students have entered their decisions, they can decide to submit their results or run the simulation again to find better answers. Students have a limited number of chances to run simulations for each goal, and a limited number of attempts at submitting an answer. </p><p>Assignable as homework or to be completed in class (or a hybrid of the two), this simulation thoroughly exposes students to the trade-offs between intuition, logic, and âhardâ data in managerial decision making.</p><p class="muted">Elie Ofek; Olivier Toubia  |  Approximate Seat Time: 60 minutes  |  #515713</p> 				<!--	     <div class="row">			 <div class="span5">  <h5>Cognitive bias</h5>		 <p>The decisions throughout the simulation were carefully designed to generate data about 4 cognitive biases:  confirmation bias, the sunk cost trap, the anchoring effect, and the framing bias. Many of the biases are illustrated by splitting students into 2 groups for each scenario faced. Each group receives information in a different way in order to elicit certain biases. This split is not apparent to students during simulation play, and it is important to not reveal this fact until afterward. The simulation debrief section provides opportunities to compare and contrast experiences between the groups and illustrate the danger these biases present in a business environment. </p>			<p class="muted">Authored by: Michael A.

For each scenario, students must find the carrying amount, the recoverable amount, and the impairment value, with the help of short interactive exercises.

The Turkish Stream was a great opportunity for Turkey to            turn itself into an energy hub of its region. It had already secured TANAP, a natural            gas pipeline to carry Azerbaijani gas to Europe through Turkey. The country&apos;s            geographical position was one of its crucial assets: to its east lay 70% of the            world&apos;s natural gas reserves; to its west was Europe, one of the biggest energy            consumers in the world. If the Turkish Stream and TANAP  pipeline projects were to go            through and  connect to other possible energy reserves within the wider region, would it            be likely that Turkey would eventually become one of Europe&apos;s main energy            corridors&mdash;perhaps even a hub? </p></article>	  	  </section><hr class="featurette-divider" id="be">      <section>	  <h4>Business Ethicsâ©</h4>        <article><h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/ETH1-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Al-Shabaab, Gatekeepers, and  the Ethics of Humanitarian Aidâ©</a></h5>        <p class="subtitle muted">Keith Krehbielâ©<br />        Stanford Graduate School of Business Case / #ETH1 / (4 pages) / Companion Case            Availableâ© </p>        <p class="new-description">Following decades of civil strife among warring clans, exacerbated by the worst            drought in decades / (2010-2012), millions of starving, dislocated Somalis resided in            crowded camps throughout the country.

Alibaba faced many choices regarding            ownership structure, trading location, IPO pricing, and IPO timing. The Hong Kong Stock            Exchange seemed like a natural fit for its IPO due to geographical, cultural, and            language proximity. Furthermore, 86.7% of Alibaba&apos;s revenues originated within            China. However, Alibaba insisted on "partnership governance," and the Hong Kong Stock            Exchange did not allow listing of companies with dual-class share structure. In            contrast, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ did not object to Alibaba&apos;s            proposed ownership structure. While the Hong Kong investors knew Alibaba&apos;s business            better, the New York exchanges provided more liquidity and visibility. Against this            backdrop, Alibaba needed to make difficult decisions regarding its IPO. <span class="label">TN</span></p></article>           <article><h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/INS824-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Bayt.com: How Bayt.com Derived  a "Place Surplus" in Dubai, U.A.E.â©</a></h5>        <p class="subtitle muted">Sami Mahroum; Elizabeth Scottâ©<br />        INSEAD Case / #INS824 / (18 pages) <span class="label">TN</span> â© </p>        <p class="new-description">The case examines the factors that influenced the founders&apos; decision to            establish Bayt.com in Dubai, and how the online job site transformed recruitment            practices in the Middle East by facilitating access to skill and talent throughout the            MENA region.

Their work at all stages of the entrepreneurial            life cycle offers many lessons to company founders, even those whose ventures are not            backed by VCs.

Notwithstanding the            availability of the capital and its cumulative knowledge of the Chinese market, the            investment screening and negotiation process in China turned out to be complex due to            the differences in business approaches and culturally embedded mindsets.

To date, American Well had            primarily sold its solution to health plans, which then provided online care services to            their members using their own brand names. But a surprisingly small number of individual            members had actually used the online care service. American Well management believed low            consumer awareness&mdash;the result of insufficient marketing by health plans, among other            factors&mdash;was hampering uptake of what should have been a highly valuable offering for all            stakeholders involved. They wondered whether a DTC approach, in which American Well            would become a consumer brand and market a telehealth service directly to the public&mdash;for            example, through a mobile app&mdash;could drive utilization and catapult the business to the            next level. The case forces students to grapple with the challenges and barriers            involved in disrupting an established industry, examine alternative go-to-market            strategies and the timing of implementing them, and consider different business models            to manage supply and generate revenues. </p></article>        <article><h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/W14684-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Banking on Social Media (A)â©</a></h5>        <p class="subtitle muted">Luisa Mazinter; Nicola Kleyn; Michael Goldman; Jennifer Lindsey-Rentonâ©<br />        Ivey Publishing Case / #W14684 / (11 pages)  B Case Availableâ© </p>        <p class="new-description">First National Bank (FNB), one of South Africa&apos;s "Big Four" banks, has            invested in a strategy of innovation to grow its market presence in South Africa, other            emerging-market African countries, and India.

At the July 2014 off-site meeting,            Smith and Kara Helander, global head of philanthropy and diversity and inclusion            (D&amp;I), provided a summary of the firm&apos;s journey to date and an update on its            progress. The message from Fink at the July meeting was clear: the firm needed to do            more. This message was also reinforced by the board, which wanted to see an increase in            diversity in succession plans and leadership ranks. Smith and his team needed to work            with the GEC to lead the change. What needed to be done next? What were the greatest            challenges and opportunities facing the firm, and how could D&amp;I initiatives help            address them? </p></article>        <article><h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/415044-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">The Board of Directors at  Market Basketâ©</a></h5>        <p class="subtitle muted">Jay W.

Following a merger with Gemini, Excel&apos;s new CEO            advocates a new manufacturing strategy: outsourcing. Regis is threatened by the            diminution in the role of in-house manufacturing and by the VP for Supply Chain            Management at Gemini. The case traces Regis&apos;s reactions to the proposal. She seems            ready to accede to the organizational politics and support the new strategy, only to            change her mind and anger her superiors, who thought she would support the plan. She            tries to seize control of the situation and threatens to resign if she is not allowed to            determine the appropriate strategy. The case facilitates analysis and discussion of            career and personal development issues regularly faced by high-potential employees by            showing that particular career and behavior strategies that are successful at one point            can become dysfunctional as professionals advance through an            organization.  <span class="label">TN</span></p></article>        <article><h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/UV6866-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">The Influence of Cultural Values in Business Practiceâ©</a></h5>        <p class="subtitle muted">Kristin Behfar; Sylvie Thompson;  Gerry Yemenâ©<br />        Darden School of Business Background Note / #UV6866 / (13 pages)â© </p>        <p class="new-description">Culture is a highly complex set of learned behaviors that function at multiple            levels.

Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of asset management, and her team had to            evaluate whether or not the program had been successful. Participants and managers both            had provided some anecdotal positive feedback on the program, but Erdoes wanted to know            how they could truly calculate the ROI. Wall Street was a data-driven place to work, and            if they wanted to create something that would survive beyond the tenure of the            firm&apos;s existing leadership, they had to prove that the time, money, and energy            invested by the firm were worth it. Calculating ROI would also help them prepare for            subsequent runs of the program and determine in what ways, if any, they should differ            from the pilot.

It is            extraordinarily difficult to rewire the human brain to undo the patterns that lead to            such mistakes. But there is another approach: alter the environment in ways that            encourage people to make decisions that lead to good outcomes. Leaders can do this by            restructuring how work is performed, say Harvard Business School&apos;s John Beshears            and Francesca Gino.
