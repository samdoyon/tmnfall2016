  			 <p><strong style="text-transform: uppercase; color: #333">THE FOOD TRUCK CHALLENGE</strong> is a short, competitive exercise that teaches students the value of learning by doing, prototyping, and being willing to fail. Created by Michael A. Roberto, author of the best-selling <em>Leadership and Team: Everest Simulation</em>, the exercise covers the challenging trade-offs that leaders face as they launch a new business, product, or service. </p>
      <p>As students try to run a successful food truck in the fictional city of Boomtown, they work individually or in teams to achieve maximum revenue over 5 simulated weeks. In each round, students make decisions in hopes of finding the best menu- location combination and yielding the highest sales. They begin by analyzing market data and making a plan, but must then decide whether to (a) go to scale right away with the food truck, (b) conduct further research and analysis, or (c) experiment with a low-capacity pushcart. In the class debrief, students learn about the trade-offs between analysis, experimentation, and scale.</p>

    			<h4>Encourage Students to Prepare and Discuss Cases </h4>
    <p>Motivating students to prepare for class and participate in discussions is a challenge many instructors face. William Ellet, adjunct professor of management communication at Brandeis International Business School and facilitator of Harvard Business Publishing’s Case Method Teaching Seminars, has compiled a list of best practices through which instructors can motivate students to prepare cases and participate in discussions. Originally starting as a conversation at the Teaching Post—HBP's forum for case instructors to discuss teaching techniques—the abbreviated list below combines Ellet's ideas with contributions from a few of his peers. </p>

Blue (as it was called) was a part of the New Space industry, a collection of start-up aerospace engineering companies that were intent on disrupting the American space sector with new technologies, new management approaches, and competitive pressure. NASA hoped to leverage New Space to outsource its near-Earth activities and refocus its own efforts on deep space exploration. One of the agency’s main mechanisms for this shift of activities was its Commercial Crew Development program (CCDev), a multiphase initiative launched in 2009. Blue participated in the first 2 rounds of CCDev, and by all accounts these had been win-win experiences for it and NASA. The decision point of the case is whether Blue should participate in the third, much larger, and more complex stage of CCDev. The trade-off facing Blue’s leaders was between the legitimacy, expertise, and funding provided by working with NASA and the autonomy, efficiency, and independence threatened by working with NASA. How would Blue, with its clear respect for NASA but its desire (and financial ability) to set its own priorities, make this trade-off? <span class="label">TN</span></p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/716069-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">South Africa: A Fractured Rainbow?</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Richard H.K.

And then, at the end of 2015, cronyism sank the stock market and the currency, causing a political crisis.

Or we may be managers, inspectors, or auditors who serve as the official "complaint recipient" when one of our colleagues wants to report wrongdoing in the organization. Whether we blow the whistle or are tasked with cleaning up after someone else does so, we are better off knowing in advance how the whistleblowing process usually plays out. In this article, the authors discuss the pragmatic implications of 30 years of systematic research about whistleblowing: who does it and when, and why they choose to report the wrongdoing internally (within the organization) or externally (to outsiders). To avoid external whistleblowing, which entails all sorts of costs for the organization, the authors recommend that managers take clear steps: investigate the allegations, make the results of the investigation known to those affected, correct the problem if one is found, and avoid reprisal against whistleblowers. These actions can increase the chance that information about organizational wrongdoing stays inside the organization, where it may be remedied, instead of being made public.</p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/316069-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Apple: Privacy vs. Safety?</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Henry McGee; Nien-he Hsieh; Sarah McAra<br />       Harvard Business School Case / #316069 / (33 pages) / B, C, and D Cases Available </p>       </p>       <p class="new-description">In 2015, Apple CEO Tim Cook debuted the iPhone 6S with enhanced security measures that enflamed a debate on privacy and public safety around the world. The iPhone 6S, amid a heightened concern for privacy following the 2013 revelation of clandestine U.S. surveillance programs, employed a default encryption system that prevented both Apple and government authorities from accessing data stored on the device. Law enforcement officials warned that the encryption hindered investigations of criminal cases and international terrorism and called on Apple to build a back door, a way to bypass the encryption. But Cook maintained that any back door would compromise customers’ privacy and security. In 2016, a federal judge ordered Apple to provide technical assistance to unlock the iPhone used by a terrorist who, along with his wife, killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Apple refused to comply with the order and asked the government to withdraw its demand. As the court case unfolded, Cook considered his responsibilities to the U.S. government as well as to Apple’s customers, employees, and shareholders.</p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/ES1691-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Corruption in Russia: IKEA’s Expansion to the East (A)</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Urs Mueller<br />       ESMT Case / #ES1691 / (8 pages) </p>       </p>       <p class="new-description">This 4-part case series can be used to discuss business ethics, compliance/governance, integrity management, and reacting to and preparing against corruption in the context of internationalization, and it touches briefly on the issue of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Case (A) describes a challenge IKEA was facing while trying to enter Russia in 2000. The company was preparing to open its first flagship store on the outskirts of Moscow, only the first of several planned projects. After substantial investments in infrastructure and logistics, IKEA focused on marketing but quickly faced a sudden complication. Its major ad campaign in the Moscow Metro with the slogan “Every 10th European was made in one of our beds” was labeled “tasteless.” IKEA had to stop the campaign because it “couldn’t prove” the claim. Soon Lennart Dahlgren, the first general manager of IKEA in Russia, must have realized that the unsuccessful ad campaign was going to be the least of his problems: a few weeks before the planned opening, the local utility company decided not to provide its services for the store if IKEA did not pay a bribe. What should IKEA and Lennart Dahlgren do? Is there any alternative to playing the game the Russian way and paying? The subsequent cases (B), (C), and (D) describe IKEA’s creative response to the challenges described in case (A), report about new challenges with alleged corruption within IKEA and in the legal environment, and finally raise the question of whether IKEA can be considered to have a social responsibility to fight corruption on a societal level in order to build the platform for its own operation in Russia. <span class="label">TN</span></p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/UV7102-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Introduction to Ethics: The Language of Ethics for Managers</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Andrew C.

The analysis will touch on intentional discrimination and harassment (“I’m firing you because you’re Christian/Jewish/other”), types of religious discrimination that are readily identifiable and resolvable. Less obviously, U.S. law requires that employers provide "reasonable accommodation" whenever a religiously neutral business practice interferes with an employee’s religious practice; this reasonable accommodation doctrine is more complex and nuanced. Providing reasonable accommodation presents obstacles for managers that are as legalistically dense as they are financially treacherous. This note aims to help managers not only identify blatantly illegal practices but also navigate the gray areas where the law is underdeveloped or inconsistently applied. The law often provides vignettes of what management legally can or cannot do, but neither laws nor the cases interpreting them provide clear answers for managers attempting to handle challenging religious issues that arise in their firms. Finally, while digesting the information provided in this note, managers must remember that this analysis describes legal solutions, not managerial ones.</p>       </article>       </section>       <hr class="featurette-divider" id="econ">       <section>       <h4>Economics</h4>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/H02JAR-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Corporations Will Never Solve Climate Change</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Auden Schendler; Naomi Oreskes<br />       <em>Harvard Business Review</em> Web Article / #H02JAR / (1,270 words) </p>       </p>       <p class="new-description">The whole notion of green business rests on the assumption that corporations want to solve the societal or environmental problems they take on, that they are not lying to us, and that we can trust what they say about their products and practices. </p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/916044-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Evive Health and Workplace Influenza Vaccinations</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">John Beshears<br />       Harvard Business School Case  / #916044 / (3 pages) </p>       </p>       <p class="new-description">Evive Health is a company that manages communication campaigns on behalf of health insurance plans and large employers.

In its bid to provide more capital for private-sector investment in developing countries, IFC played a key role in the emergence of the private equity industry in these markets through its funds’ investments and, later, created its own third-party fund management platform: IFC Asset Management Company (AMC). Through the experience of AMC, the case considers broader issues typically faced by a private equity business in setting its strategy: how can a fund manager decide the optimal size of assets under management? Given its resources and capabilities, what new funds could a firm raise, and what sectors should it target? The case further delves into the working mechanisms of AMC and thereby explains how AMC, as a special type of fund manager, handles different phases of private equity business. Finally, the case considers the key challenges IFC and AMC face today and assesses what the future might hold for each. As the largest global development institution focusing on the private sector, IFC had been an important player in developing countries. However, IFC’s target markets continue to rapidly evolve and attract more capital and players, both local and international. How could IFC stay relevant and continue to play a differentiated leadership role in emerging markets under these circumstances?

A customer would choose a recipe on Dinr’s web site and would receive all premeasured ingredients the same evening at their doorstep. Contrary to many existing similar companies, Dinr would not require a weekly subscription, but would provide one-off orders like other traditional food delivery services. Berger had already carried out an alpha test of the service and completed an in-depth survey of potential customers to explore the market. Most of the feedback was positive, which confirmed Berger’s intuition about this market opportunity. Berger had found a more experienced cofounder with technical expertise who was willing to join Dinr part time and gathered £40,000 of initial capital. Yet making the decision to leave his corporate job and become an entrepreneur was not easy: was Dinr a good business opportunity? Would it be attractive to outside investors?

Stall-out occurs when the growth engine that powered companies to success stops working. This rarely happens because the business model has suddenly become obsolete—a common misconception. Rather, research by Zook and Allen shows that the business has almost always become too complex, most often owing to bureaucracy that slows the company’s metabolism or to internal dysfunction that distorts information and hampers managers’ ability to make rapid decisions and take swift action on them. But stall-out can be overcome. The authors find that most companies that achieve sustainable growth share certain attitudes and behaviors: (1) they view themselves as business insurgents, fighting on behalf of underserved customers; (2) they have an obsession with the front line, where the business meets the customer; and (3) they foster a mindset that includes a deep sense of responsibility for how resources are used and for long-term results.

During 2012, as the firm struggled with a weak competitive position and a transition to a new 3G platform, its operating results suffered, and a number of analysts were concerned about the firm’s liquidity. Against this backdrop, NII decides to refocus its operations on Mexico and Brazil. In April 2013, the company enters into an agreement to sell Nextel Peru to Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones S.A. (Entel) for between $397 million and $415 million. Through the use of Andean Capital Advisors and its first-year associate Rafael d’Anconia, the case is meant to demonstrate concepts surrounding the derivation of the cost of capital in international settings. The case was designed for use in first-year MBA courses, but it can also be adopted for courses focusing on international finance. <span class="label">TN</span></p>       </article>       </section>       <hr class="featurette-divider" id="gm">       <section>       <h4>General Management</h4>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/W16147-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Apple and Its Suppliers: Corporate Social Responsibility</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Sun Hye Lee; Michael Mol; Kamel MellahiIvey <br />       Ivey Publishing Case / #W16147 / (10 pages) </p>       </p>       <p class="new-description">In a 2014 documentary, the multinational technology company Apple Inc. was implicated in alleged human rights violations at Pegatron, a large Chinese supplier that assembled Apple’s iPhones.

According to data collected by the authors over the past 2 decades, the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50% or more. There is much to applaud about these developments—but when consumption of a valuable resource spikes that dramatically, it should also give us pause. At many companies, people spend around 80% of their time in meetings or answering colleagues’ requests, leaving little time for all the critical work they must complete on their own. What’s more, research the authors have done across more than 300 organizations shows that the apportionment of collaborative work is often extremely lopsided. In most cases, 20% to 35% of value-added collaborations come from only 3% to 5% of employees. The avalanche of demands for input or advice, access to resources, or sometimes just presence in a meeting causes performance to suffer. Employees take assignments home, and soon burnout and turnover become real risks. Leaders must start to manage collaboration more effectively in 2 ways: (1) by mapping the supply and demand in their organizations and redistributing the work more evenly among employees, and (2) by incentivizing people to collaborate more efficiently.</p>       </article>

<p style="display: table-cell">A good visualization can communicate the nature and potential impact of information and ideas more powerfully than any other form of communication. This book provides a guide to how visualization works and how to use this new language to impress and persuade. By tapping into both well-established and cutting-edge research in visual perception and neuroscience, as well as the emerging field of visualization science, this book explores why good charts (and bad ones) create “feelings behind our eyes.”

They were in the unique position of having no real direct competitors and a tight grip on a niche market within a $15 billion industry. However, to achieve their growth ambitions for the company, the duo had to deftly navigate the changing competitive landscape, identifying which players could become real competitors and which could be co-opted into becoming partners and clients. They also needed to adapt their business model to capture these opportunities. Over time, their expensive expansion standards and operating costs began to present a nagging concern: with only so much capital available each year, just how quickly could Convene really grow? Would the capital intensiveness of their current model stymie the rapid growth that they so desperately wanted (and needed) to achieve in order to establish a nationally recognized brand? <span class="label">TN</span></p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/R1512F-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Find Innovation Where You Least Expect It</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Tony McCaffrey; Jim Pearson<br />       <em>Harvard Business Review</em> Article / #R1512F / (9 pages) </p>       </p>       <p class="new-description">When the Titanic collided with an iceberg and sank, only 705 of its 2,200 passengers and crew, floating in 16 lifeboats, were saved. Imagine how many more might have lived if crew members had thought of the iceberg as not just the cause of the disaster but a lifesaving solution. The iceberg rose high above the water and stretched nearly 400 feet in length. The lifeboats, or the Titanic itself, might have been able to pull close enough to the iceberg for people to scramble on. Regardless of whether this could actually have worked, it’s an intriguing idea—yet surprisingly difficult to envision. That’s because a cognitive bias called “functional fixedness” limits people to seeing objects only in the way in which they’re traditionally used. In a nautical context, an iceberg is a hazard to be avoided; it’s very hard to see it any other way. When it comes to innovation, businesses are constantly hampered by functional fixedness and other cognitive biases that cause people to overlook elegant solutions hidden in plain sight. We can overcome this bias—and similar biases about an object’s design and purpose—by changing how we describe the object and how we think about its component parts. This article also presents techniques and tools to help managers think in innovative ways—a process the authors call “brainswarming”—about common business problems, whether in conceiving new products, finding novel applications for existing products, or anticipating competitive threats.</p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/W15592-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Google Glass: Development, Marketing, and User Acceptance</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Thompson S.H.

Good conflict fosters respectful debate and yields mutually agreed-upon solutions that are often far superior to those first offered. Bad conflict occurs when team members simply can’t get past their differences, killing productivity and stifling innovation. Destructive conflict typically stems not from differences of opinion but from a perceived incompatibility between the ways certain team members think and act. The conventional approach to working through such conflict is to respond to clashes as they arise. But this approach routinely fails because it allows frustrations to build for too long, making it difficult to reset negative impressions and restore trust. In their research on team dynamics and experience working with executive teams, Toegel and Barsoux have found a proactive approach to be much more effective. In this article, they introduce a methodology that focuses on how people look, act, speak, think, and feel. Team leaders facilitate 5 conversations—1 focused on each category—before the team gets under way to build a shared understanding of the process, rather than the content, of work and to lay the foundation for effective collaboration.</p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/316135-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Uber in China: Driving in the Gray Zone</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">William C.

Though several of Pacific Lake’s transactions involved complex financial structures, Andrews had learned that few issues were more difficult than some of the interpersonal challenges that confronted him from time to time. In the first vignette, Andrews learns that a searcher with whom Pacific Lake has made a soft commitment to invest has falsified part of his resume.

Companies often conduct programs without ever measuring their impact. And unfortunately, research on their effectiveness shows they seldom change attitudes, let alone behavior. The solution? Focus on processes, not people. Behavioral science tells us that it’s very hard to eliminate our biases, but we can redesign organizations to circumvent them. Behavioral design makes it easier to do the unbiased thing by either preventing biased choices or changing people’s beliefs. Companies can start by collecting data on their current diversity training. Then they must bring the same rigor to people management that they apply to financial and marketing decisions. This means defining the desired change, implementing new programs, collecting hard data, and evaluating the results. Even simple changes can be effective. For example, hiring managers can use software that allows them to strip age, gender, socioeconomic background, and similar information out of resumes so that they focus only on talent. Bias affects everyone, despite efforts at awareness and the best of intentions. The good news, say the authors, is that behavioral design can break the link between our gut reactions and our actions and allow our biased minds to get things right.</p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/ROT288-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Healthy Employees, Healthy Workplace</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Ilona Bray<br />       <em>Rotman Management Magazine</em> Article / #ROT288 / (5 pages) </p>       </p>       <p class="new-description">The author describes how forward-looking employers are developing new initiatives that promote employee health and well-being—everything from on-site health screenings to exercise equipment and meditation classes.

Fee for service, the dominant payment model in the U.S. and many other countries, is now widely recognized as perhaps the single biggest obstacle to improving health care delivery. A battle is currently raging, outside the public eye, between the advocates of 2 radically different payment approaches: capitation and bundled payments. The stakes are high, and the outcome will define the shape of the health care system for many years to come, for better or for worse. In this article, the authors argue that although capitation may deliver modest savings in the short run, it brings significant risks and will fail to fundamentally change the trajectory of a broken system. The bundled payment model, in contrast, triggers competition between providers to create value where it matters—at the individual patient level—and puts health care on the right path. The authors provide robust proof-of-concept examples of bundled payment initiatives in the U.S. and abroad, address the challenges of transitioning to bundled payments, and respond to critics’ concerns about obstacles to implementation.</p>       </article>

Thus, companies must learn from them—why they stay, why they leave, and how the organization needs to change. A thoughtful exit interview—whether a face-to-face conversation, a questionnaire, a survey, or a combination of these—can catalyze leaders’ listening skills, reveal what does or doesn’t work inside the organization, highlight hidden challenges and opportunities, and generate essential competitive intelligence. It can promote engagement and enhance retention by signaling to employees that their views matter. And it can turn departing employees into corporate ambassadors for years to come. Unfortunately, too few leaders pay attention to this tool; their programs fail to either improve retention or produce useful information. The authors believe this is owing to poor data quality and a lack of consensus on best practices. They suggest 6 overall goals for a strategic exit interview process and describe tactics and techniques to make it successful. Among their recommendations: have interviews conducted by second- or third-line managers. Make exit interviews mandatory for at least some employees. And because standard interviews enable you to spot trends but unstructured ones elicit unexpected insights, consider combining the 2 approaches in semistructured interviews.</p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/616042-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">SAP SE: Autism at Work</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Gary P.

The company has a stated objective of making 1% of its workforce people with autism by 2020. SAP’s rationale for the program is based on the belief that neurodiversity contributes to the company’s overall innovative capabilities (“We believe that innovation comes from the edges.”) Thus, the program is not viewed as a subsidized corporate social responsibility activity but as a positive net benefit activity, as well as a way of addressing skills shortages by tapping into nontraditional pools of (considerable) talent. The case explores how SAP is also using the program to rethink and reengineer its human resource management policies and processes to make them more inclusive and effective.</p>       </article>       </section>       <hr class="featurette-divider" id="it">       <section>       <h4>Information Technology</h4>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/H02OOC-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Apple vs. the FBI Is Really, Really Complicated</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Scott Berinato<br />       <em>Harvard Business Review</em> Web Article / #H02OOC / (2,080 words) </p>       </p>       <p class="new-description">Apple’s Tim Cook appears to be mad as hell.

Such unstructured big data is generated in real time, is easily accessed, and contains messages consumers want managers to hear. Analyzing such data has the potential to revolutionize market research and competitive analysis, but how can the messages be extracted? How can the vast amount of data be condensed into insights to help steer businesses’ strategy? The authors describe a nonproprietary technique that can be applied by anyone with statistical training. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) can analyze huge amounts of text and describe the content as focusing on unseen attributes in a specific weighting. For example, a review of a graphic novel might be analyzed to focus 70% on the story line and 30% on the graphics. Aggregating the content from numerous consumers allows us to understand what is, collectively, on consumers’ minds, and from this we can infer what consumers care about. We can even highlight which attributes are seen positively or negatively. The value of this technique extends well beyond the CMO’s office, as LDA can map the relative strategic positions of competitors where they matter most: in the minds of consumers.</p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/H02JOL-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Using Big Data to Make Wiser Medical Decisions</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">John D.

The location of R&D in developing countries was initially driven largely by the availability of skilled personnel at low cost. At first, these R&D centers in emerging markets operated primarily as extended arms of R&D in the home country, executing well-defined projects under close supervision by headquarters. However, the dynamics of multinationals’ R&D centers are rapidly changing. Emerging markets are new growth drivers of the global economy, and their unique bundle of opportunities and challenges can be a wellspring of innovation for a multinational company. Simultaneously, many R&D centers in emerging markets have evolved to accumulate advanced technical capabilities, leading their employees to clamor for highervalue-added work and to seek responsibility for a complete product or technology. Given these trends, R&D subsidiaries in emerging markets are uniquely positioned to play an important role in multinational companies’ innovation strategy. However, this thinking is often at odds with the dominant innovation mindset, structures, and processes within multinational companies based in developed countries. This article advances a framework that can be used by managers in multinational companies to support the key decisions on innovating for emerging markets. The framework is based on learnings gleaned from the successful development of the ASR 901 aggregation services routers, a product family that was conceptualized and developed by Cisco’s India R&D center for emerging-market customers but was also adopted by global customers. The authors argue that managers in emerging-country R&D outfits need to consider 3 key factors before they embark on innovation for local and similar markets: the technological capability of the R&D unit, the size and uniqueness of the market opportunity, and the presence of executive champions both at headquarters and at the subsidiary.</p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/W15636-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Nestlé S.A.: Nescafé Plan in China</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Robert Klassen; Ramasastry Chandrasekhar<br />       Ivey Publishing Case / #W15636 / (18 pages) </p>       </p>       <p class="new-description">Nestlé S.A., in an effort to integrate sustainability into its business model, has recently established the Nescafé Plan.

Nestlé’s manager of creating shared value in the beverages strategic business unit faces 2 core dilemmas in executing this plan in China. In the short term, should Nestlé purchase green coffee beans that are socially or environmentally certified (i.e., fair trade), or should it instead expand its efforts to work directly with farmers to develop better farming practices?

(Petrobras) became one of the largest integrated oil and gas companies, gaining a reputation for sound leadership and strong technical expertise. By the mid-2000's the company was often cited as one of the best-managed national oil companies. By 2016, Petrobras was in a very different position. The company was embroiled in a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal and was one of the most indebted companies in the world. The decade-long corruption scheme reached the highest levels of business and Brazilian politics—Brazil’s president, Dilma Rousseff, was the chairwoman of the Petrobras board from 2003 to 2010. Several senior Petrobras executives and Brazilian politicians had been arrested on allegations of bid rigging and bribery, and more arrests were likely. Petrobras, already forced to write down the value of its assets by $14.9 billion in 2015, now faced a $2.1 billion price tag for the scandal. Capital investments would be reduced significantly over the next 5 years in order to reduce debt and help recover investor confidence. <span class="label">TN</span></p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/TB0437-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">The U.S.-China Wind Power Dispute</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Roy C.

Although China was clearly violating World Trade Organization (WTO) rules with its trade policies, U.S. and other firms were reluctant to bring a dispute to the WTO for fear of retaliation on the part of the Chinese government in the form of loss of access to the Chinese market. As a result, the United Steel Workers of America trade union brought the dispute to the WTO. Because the trade violations were so clear, China backed down even before the dispute could get out of the first “consultations” phase of the WTO dispute settlement process. <span class="label">TN</span></p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/W16054-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Walton: Building a Global Brand through Internationalization</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Mohammad B.

To achieve Walton’s mission of “Walton at every home,” the company established various specialized support units both inside and outside Bangladesh.

Flipkart has grown into an online retail giant, valued at over $15.2 billion as of 2015. Flipkart, which has been selling over 30 million products from more than 50,000 sellers in 70-plus categories, has 30 exclusive brand associations, with an in-a-day guarantee in 50 cities and a same-day guarantee in 13 cities. Flipkart was 33,000 people strong and had over 50 million registered users with over 10 million daily visits and 8 million shipments per month. Flipkart has been putting in much effort and emphasis on the use of analytics in every aspect of decision making. Headed by Ravi Vijayaraghavan, the analytics team had over 100 data scientists in 2015. Customer churn is a major concern for Flipkart since it has direct impact on customer lifetime value (CLV). CLV is an important measure to differentiate customers, which can further help the organization manage them effectively. The main challenge in calculating the lifetime value of customers of e-commerce companies such as Flipkart is that the exact life of the customer is unknown owing to data truncation—that is, the actual point in time of customer churn, which may not be identified in e-commerce since there would be no prior communication from the customer about the churn. Hence, traditional models of CLV calculation may not be appropriate for e-commerce companies such as Flipkart. <span class="label">TN</span></p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/516072-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Cyberdyne: A Leap to the Future</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Doug J.

       <p class="new-description">This Reading begins with an overview of marketing communications strategy and then presents a framework for designing strategies to optimize consumer engagement. This framework offers managers 3 broad phases for developing a marketing communications plan: strategic intent, strategic execution, and strategic impact. Crafting such a plan ensures that coordinated and complementary messages are delivered in an integrated marketing communications plan across all consumer touchpoints. This Reading contains 2 interactive illustrations: “Budgeting for Marketing Communications,” which illustrates the objective-and-task budgeting method with a hierarchy of effects perspective, and “Viral Effect of Marketing,” which explores the likelihood that a shared YouTube video will “go viral.” The Reading also contains links to 2 video clips, the Taco Bell “Routine Republic” advertisement, a classic example of a conflict-based story, and “Cracking the Code of Super Bowl Ad Effectiveness,” which describes research linking viewers’ brain activity to the emotional connection of effective ads. Please note: this Reading does not cover the complexity of digital marketing.

For sports firms, athletes play a special role, as they are the firms’ ambassadors and the focus of virtual communities of fans. For most athletes, social media is a powerful tool to take advantage of their time in the spotlight. However, social media has much more potential. This work analyzes the social media profile and content created by 6 well-known sports figures—Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant—to develop a model for social media use.

The best strategy, says the author, is to focus not on detecting lies but on preventing them. She outlines 5 tactics that research has shown to be effective: (1) Encourage reciprocity. You can build trust and prompt other parties to disclose strategic information by sharing information yourself. (2) Ask the right questions. Negotiators often lie by omission, keeping mum about relevant facts, but if directly asked, they are more likely to respond honestly. (3) Watch for dodging. Don’t let your counterparts sidestep your questions—write them down in advance, take notes on the answers, and make sure you get the information you’re seeking. (4) Don’t dwell on confidentiality. Studies show that the more you reassure others that you’ll protect their privacy, the more guarded and apt to lie they become. So be nonchalant when discussing sensitive topics. (5) Cultivate leaks. People often reveal information unwittingly, so listen carefully for any slips and try indirect approaches to gaining information.</p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/916027-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Negotiating the Path of Abraham, 2015 Progress and Challenges</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">James K.

The Abraham Path Initiative seeks to revitalize a route of Middle East cultural tourism following Abraham’s path 4,000 years ago. It begins in the ancient ruins of Harran, in modern-day Turkey, where Abraham first heard the call to “go forth.” It passes through some of the world’s most revered cultural, historical, and holy sites, ending in the city of Hebron/AI-Khalil at the tomb of Abraham. With Abraham as a venerated patriarchal figure for Islam, Judaism, and Christianity—monotheistic religions whose adherents have so often clashed—the potential unifying power of this conception has attracted a remarkable range of supporters from around the world as well as considerable media interest and a major World Bank grant. The walkable part of the path has been lengthened from 300 km 5 years ago to over 2,000 km today, with various parts walked by thousands of people. Several challenges nonetheless remain, including regional war and turmoil, sustainable funding, tensions over the path’s activities in Israel, and possible next steps for the initiative.</p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/916037-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Three-Way Organization</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">James K.

Choosing the best development path was a challenge as the teams had less than 3 years to prepare, and each decision would affect the performance of the boat as well as the duration of the sailors’ training. The case traces the dilemma faced by the favorite, Oracle Team USA (OTUSA), as rumors grew that the challenger was pursuing a revolutionary technology that would enable its 6-ton boat to literally fly above waves. With only a year left before the competition, should OTUSA keep refining its current technology, called “skimming,” or should it pivot toward "foiling" (flying)? At this stage foiling could be a red herring, and even if it were not, the limits of the performance of a foiling boat would remain a mystery for some time. The case explores the dilemma of managing innovation in an uncertain environment, where the decision would be sanctioned a year later by a win or a loss.</p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/916503-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">ClearEyes Cataracts Clinic</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Roy D.

The company is the largest buyer of world hazelnuts (25%). The company procures hazelnuts from Oltan, the world’s largest producer of processed hazelnuts, with a market share of 25% to 30%. Ferrero purchases almost 70% of Oltan’s hazelnut production. Recently, crop damage reduced the harvest of hazelnut crop, which in turn increased the price of hazelnuts. One customer, Esha, is concerned about hazelnut supply issues and the price increase of Nutella, a chocolate spread with hazelnut as a major ingredient. Esha is considering Ferrero’s vertical integration, in which it may decide to purchase large producers such as Oltan. Further, Esha is also evaluating the implication of such a strategy for the final market prices of Nutella. <span class="label">TN</span></p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/BAB224-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">The Grommet: Managing Operations at a Fast-Paced Start-Up</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Sebastian Fixson; Paul Mulligan<br />       Babson College Case / #BAB224 / (19 pages) </p>       </p>       <p class="new-description">The case focuses on a start-up, The Grommet, which views itself as an intermediary between small and independent makers of high-quality products and the sophisticated buyers who value the uniqueness of those products. The Grommet, initially called Daily Grommet but renamed in 2011, was founded to create a more equitable link between product creators and product consumers. The founders trademarked the term Citizen Commerce as the manifestation of this equitable foundation for merchandising. The 2 cofounders, Jules Pieri and Joanne Domeniconi, have been serving as the company’s CEO and chief discovery officer, respectively. The company grew steadily but slowly during its first years. The case’s main protagonist is Ray Hallare, who finds himself responsible for ordering decisions for the upcoming December holiday selling season. As preparation, students are asked to develop an ordering and inventory strategy for Ray. The discussion in class then commences as an inventory case, and it successively expands to a broader and broader view of the business model itself and the challenges and opportunities that growth creates for this start-up. <span class="label">TN</span></p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/616040-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Haiti Hope: Innovating the Mango Value Chain</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Amy C.

The New York Times published an article that portrayed Amazon as a ruthless employer with brutal human resource management practices and a toxic work atmosphere. Employees were divided in their opinions; some found the culture invigorating, and others found it hard to survive in. Leaders in the industry came to Amazon’s defense, while employees at other organizations began to disclose their own experiences of toxic work environments.

That’s what most everyone said GM needed to do after its 2014 recall crisis. Cultural reform has likewise been proposed as the solution to the corrosive bureaucracy at the Veterans Administration, unethical behavior in banks, and the excessive use of force by police. But the authors’ interviews with successful change makers suggest that culture isn’t something you “fix.” Rather, cultural change is what you get when you put new processes or structures in place to tackle tough business challenges. Organizations are complex systems with many ripple effects—and reworking fundamental practices will inevitably lead to new values and behaviors. In this article, the authors explain how this played out during 4 major transformations: the remake of Ecolab into a diversified corporation 3 times its original size; the post-bankruptcy merger of Delta and Northwest, the turnaround of Ford, and Novartis’s shift to a diversified health care portfolio. Each firm’s CEO took a different approach for a different end. Ecolab’s Doug Baker pushed decisions down to the front lines to strengthen customer relationships. Delta’s Richard Anderson got airline workers on board by focusing on meeting their needs. Ford’s Alan Mulally broke down barriers between units to improve collaboration and efficiency. Novartis’s Daniel Vasella decentralized to unleash creative energy. But in every case, when the executives used tools such as decision rights, performance measurement, and reward systems to address their particular business challenges, organizational culture evolved as a result, reinforcing the new direction.</p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/416025-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Die Mannschaft: How Germany Won the 2014 FIFA World Cup</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Boris Groysberg; Sascha L.

The Reading then discusses 7 common biases or heuristics, along with ways to mitigate them, and lists additional common biases to show the broad range of issues that can influence decision making. The authors also describe biases and additional decision-making challenges that are particular to groups. Finally, the Reading draws on Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein’s concept of choice architecture to present a new framework for better decision making.  <span class="label">TN</span></p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/8330-HTM-ENG" target="_blank">Organizational Behavior Reading:Developing Your Managerial Career</a></h5>

There are several ways to produce a reliable picture of where it makes sense to add and where to cut back. </p>       </article>       </section>       <hr class="featurette-divider" id="sm">       <section>       <h4>Service Management</h4>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/H02P18-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">The Best Luxury Services Are Customized, Not Standardized</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Ana Brant<br />      <em>Harvard Business Review</em> Web Article / #H02P18 / (1,241 words) </p>       </p>       <p class="new-description">Catering to the individual is what defines luxury; in the luxury segment, it is the critical competitive differentiator.

Tager is contemplating how to measure and convey the program’s expected impact on elephant and rhino poaching as well as on poverty alleviation in South Africa. The case study highlights the importance of well-planned CSR programs and addresses topics such as blended business models, the “theory of change” underlying CSR strategy, and the challenges involved in defining and measuring impact. The case also explores organizational challenges and tensions related to adopting a new CSR strategy, including whether companies have a responsibility to actively engage in advocacy and devote significant resources to social and environmental objectives, or whether such efforts violate the fiduciary responsibility that CEOs have to shareholders. <span class="label">TN</span></p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/SCG513-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">InVenture: Building Credit Scoring Tools for the Base of the Pyramid</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Abby Fifer Mandell; Megan Strawther; James Zhu<br />       Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies—USC Marshall Case / #SCG513 / (19 pages) </p>       </p>       <p class="new-description">In 2011, Shivani Siroya founded InVenture, a social enterprise aimed at providing credit scores and accounting tools for individuals in emerging markets who traditionally lacked access to formal financial institutions.

DWR is a highly effective chemical treatment used to waterproof jackets (supporting the quality objective, but it has by-products that are toxic and that persist in the environment (undermining the sustainability objective). This case presents Patagonia’s (and the industry’s) challenges; its history trying to resolve the problem, including research; its temporary solution to use a less harmful but less effective option in C6; and its investment in Beyond Surface Technologies through $20 Million & Change, among others. The case also discusses external issues such as competitors and their efforts, pressure from Greenpeace, governmental involvement, and chemical industry actions. At the higher level, the case focuses on the question of how companies like Patagonia drive innovation down the supply chain to chemical and material suppliers, as well as how they think about innovation/disruption across the entire system, all the while grappling with internal tensions between performance, durability, and their commitment to cause no unnecessary environmental harm. <span class="label">TN</span></p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/316140-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Rumie: Bringing Digital Education to the Underserved</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">John J-H Kim; Amram Migdal<br />       Harvard Business School Case / #316140 / (27 pages) </p>       </p>       <p class="new-description">In fall of 2015, the Toronto, Canada-based education technology nonprofit Rumie had distributed thousands of computer tablets preloaded with collections of thousands of pieces of curated educational content to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in some of the most impoverished countries around the world that lacked basic educational resources. Founder and executive director Tariq Fancy, with his team, was deciding whether to accept a large new order from an NGO in Pakistan that would require Rumie for the first time to provide ongoing services such as teacher training, performance monitoring, and other support. Some on the team felt that providing a full suite of bundled services would detract from their recent push to decouple Rumie’s software and services from the physical tablets to achieve greater reach and scale. In October 2015, Rumie opened the LearnCloud, its proprietary online content curation portal for NGOs, to the public. Now anyone could discover, share, and rate free digital educational content from any source. Fancy considered, “Education access represents a big order and huge growth, but does it lead us into doing things we haven’t done before, [that we] may not be good at, and [that] may not be scalable to be used by different partners in different geographies?”</p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/B5854-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Single Stop USA: Scaling the Model</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Kristiana Raube<br />       UC Berkeley—Haas School of Business Case / #B5854 / (19 pages) </p>       </p>       <p class="new-description">The Single Stop USA case focuses on a nonprofit organization that supported low-income people and families in building economic security.

Etsy’s status as a B Corporation meant that social responsibility was ingrained in its mission. However, as an online marketplace for artisanal goods, Etsy faced a number of challenges. Principal among them was the launch of the new online store “Handmade” at Amazon, a direct attack on Etsy. Etsy had a core base of merchants and buyers, but Amazon had significantly more of both as well as a higher level of financial security than Etsy. Etsy’s fast growth had also put pressure on its merchants’ ability to offer larger quantities of handmade goods. Many merchants were pressing the company to allow sales from large-scale manufacturing, a path the company had eschewed since its start. Could Etsy find a way to successfully confront these challenges while maintaining its B Corporation ethos? <span class="label">TN</span></p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/IN1182-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">The Marvel Way: Restoring a Blue Ocean</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">W.

Financially, McDonald’s is struggling, with declining sales growth, a 15% decrease in net income, and stock prices below its 2012 price point, while the overall market is on the rise. The company is not benefiting from the economic recovery, as consumer preferences (especially among millennials) are shifting toward healthier options for dining out. Meanwhile, competition is fierce, with several direct competitors (e.g., Wendy’s), higher-end burger joints (e.g., In-and-Out Burger), and fast casual chains (e.g., Panera) all outperforming the burger giant. Internally, the company is struggling with defining its strategic identity. Menu diversification has increased operational complexity, which has slowed service times. Efforts to attract new customers by adding higher-end items have shifted McDonald’s price points upward, while customer perceptions of quality and willingness to pay are at an all-time low. The company’s size makes it an easy target for labor activists and health advocates, further compounding its public perception issues. By trying to be all things to all people, McDonald’s finds itself in a classic “stuck in the middle” strategic dilemma. Easterbrook must find a way to be a strategic leader who is willing to make tough decisions and transform McDonald’s into a “modern, progressive burger company.” <span class="label">TN</span></p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/R1604C-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Pipelines, Platforms, and the New Rules of Strategy</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Marshall W.

But it describes competition among traditional "pipeline" businesses, which succeed by optimizing the activities in their value chains—most of which they own or control. “Platform” businesses that bring together consumers and producers, as Uber, Alibaba, and Airbnb do, require a different approach to strategy. The critical asset of a platform is external—the community of members. The focus shifts from controlling resources to orchestrating them, and firms win by facilitating more external interactions and creating "network effects" that increase the value provided to all participants. In this new world, competition can emerge from seemingly unrelated industries and even from within the platform itself. The authors, 3 platform strategists, walk executives through the choices they must make when building platforms, outlining the different metrics needed to manage them. Businesses that fail to learn the new rules will struggle, they argue. When a platform enters the marketplace of a pure pipeline business, the platform nearly always wins. That’s exactly what happened when the iPhone came on the scene in 2007. By 2015, it accounted for 92% of global profits in mobile phones, while most of the giants that once ruled the industry made no profit at all.</p>       </article>       <article>       <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/MH0032-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Tesla Motors, Inc.</a></h5>       <p class="subtitle muted">Frank T.

UFO’s satellite-based technology enables a significantly wider release of films compared with traditional analog prints and standard, higher-resolution digital prints that must be transported physically. By 2015, 54% of all cinemas in India are using UFO’s digital cinema system. UFO has achieved this without upsetting the industry’s value chain of producer–traditional distributor–cinema owner. The company earns revenue through 3 main streams: fees charged to the producer/distributor for converting films to digital format and distributing them over satellite, fees charged to the cinema owner for leasing the projection systems, and advertising revenue from ads shown during the screening of films. With cinemas in India mostly digitized, however, UFO faces challenges to continual growth. Should UFO focus on increasing its advertising revenue, leveraging its core technology in other areas, or entering the business of film distribution? <span class="label">TN</span></p>       </article>       <article class="well ad">            <div class="ad-header"><h5>NEW BOOK FOR ACADEMIC USE </h5></div>            <div class="ad-body">   <span class="pull-left " style="padding-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 15px;   max-width: 170px"><img alt="Good Charts" src="https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/resources/marketing/images/Zenger15030_silo_lrg.png">            <p style="font-size: 75%; line-height: 120%; font-weight: bold; color: #b11f25">Available as an eBook — 50% off in digital coursepacks.</p>            </span>      <div style="padding-left: 150px">            <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/15030-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Beyond Competitive Advantage<br />              How to Solve the Puzzle of Sustaining Growth while Creating Value            </a></span>            <p class="muted"><strong>Todd Zenger, University of Utah</strong></p>            <p style="display: table-cell">Behind every long-term corporate success is a basic theory about how that company creates value.
