color: #333">IN THIS NEW SINGLE-PLAYER SIMULATION,</strong> students learn how to use one of the most popular market research methods: conjoint analysis. Through 2 different exercisesâone set in the âgreen carâ segment of the auto industry, and another in the health care marketplaceâthis simulation shows students how conjoint analysis output is relevant in practice. It also provides an interactive experience of using conjoint analysis for managerial decision making.</p>			 <p>This simulation gives students concrete exposure to key business concepts such as demand curves, segmentation, profit functions, competitive responses, vertical and horizontal differentiation, optimal pricing, niche vs. mass market strategies, product portfolio management, and brand equity.</p>			<p>During the 2 exercises, students workâas product managerâon a series of goals and face a host of competitive settings. To inform their decisions, students have access to results of a conjoint analysis study. They can view these results in various ways and can run market simulations under multiple conditions to learn various data points, such as forecasted demand in units or sales revenue at different price points. </p>			<h5>Playing the simulation</h5>		<p>In both the âgreen carâ and health care exercises, students can be given a variety of business goals to achieve. Students will need to consider new market conditions when completing each goal, including new business objectives, changing competition, and a varied set of constraints.</p> 		<p>After each business goal is presented in detail, students are given the following steps to complete each goal:</p>		<ol>		<li>Review the conjoint output. (Videos are provided to aid the students in their analysis of the data.)</li>		<li>Review the product(s) in the marketplace.</li>		<li>Select attribute levels for the proposed product and run the market choice predictor to see how the product will perform in the marketplace.</li><li>Submit a solution or run another simulation.</li></ol><p>When students run a simulation, the market choice predictor uses the conjoint data to determine the commercial performance of each product in the market, including the product configured in the simulator. </p><p>Once students have entered their decisions, they can decide to submit their results or run the simulation again to find better answers. Students have a limited number of chances to run simulations for each goal, and a limited number of attempts at submitting an answer. </p><p>Assignable as homework or to be completed in class (or a hybrid of the two), this simulation thoroughly exposes students to the trade-offs between intuition, logic, and âhardâ data in managerial decision making.</p><p class="muted">Elie Ofek; Olivier Toubia  |  Approximate Seat Time: 60 minutes  |  #515713</p> <blockquote style="background-color: #e8eef4; border-left: 5px solid #80a1b6;  margin-top: 15px; padding: 12px; ">		 <h3>Conjoint Analysis Toolkit</h3>		 <h4>TO COMPLEMENT THIS SIMULATION THE TOOLKIT INCLUDES:</h4>		 		 </blockquote>      		<h5><a href="https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/pages/content/corecurriculum">Conjoint Analysis: Online Tutorial</a></h5>		<p>The Conjoint Analysis: Online Tutorial is intended to facilitate understanding of this popular market research method.

Many of the biases are illustrated by splitting students into 2 groups for each scenario faced. Each group receives information in a different way in order to elicit certain biases. This split is not apparent to students during simulation play, and it is important to not reveal this fact until afterward. The simulation debrief section provides opportunities to compare and contrast experiences between the groups and illustrate the danger these biases present in a business environment. </p>			<p class="muted">Authored by: Michael A.

The rewards to executives and            financiers have skyrocketed as a result. But over the past 2 decades or so, the author            argues, it has become increasingly clear that much of this talent is trading value            rather than creating it: the fastest-growing group on the Forbes 400 list is hedge fund            managers. What's more, stock-based incentives, which were intended to align the            interests of top executives with those of long-term shareholders, are actually            encouraging CEOs to serve the interests of short-term traders. The losers in this game            are employees engaged in routine work, whose rewards are shrinking or whose jobs are            disappearing. This state of affairs has created a growing, and unsustainable, inequality            of income. â©         </p></article>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/HKS774-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Wellness Is Everyone's Business: Public-Private Partnerships for Health in            Minnesotaâ©         </a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Arnold M.

In Minnesota, even as the recession started to subside, analyses of the            state budget indicated that it needed new strategies for slowing the growth rate of            health care spending, and in response the state legislature passed a major health reform            law that, among other things, aimed to reduce costs. This case tells the story of how            leaders of the Statewide Health Improvement Program (SHIP) initiative worked with            businesses and corporate executives in an effort to have as far-reaching an impact as            possible. â©         </p></article></section><hr class="featurette-divider" id="be">      <section>	  <h4>Business Ethicsâ©</h4>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/INS672-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Barrick Gold Corporation:  Perfect Storm at Pascua Lama</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Erin McCormick; Craig N.

This article argues that efforts to fight fraud and other forms of corporate            misconduct have failed in part due to the systematic approach employed toward a problem            that is irregular, complex, and extends well beyond the boundary of the firm. By drawing            upon research from the field of behavioral ethics to suggest a new approach that does            more than just stress formal control systems, this case illustrates how executives may            strengthen organizational ethics through informal practices that work from the bottom up            and the outside in.

McClure, an outspoken personality            in Silicon Valley, believes that the venture capital industry is not innovating quickly            enough to adapt to large-scale changes. The cost of starting a company has plummeted            over time, enabling investors to write smaller and smaller checks. The exit options for            companies have expanded, allowing investors to realize returns earlier than in the past,            though typically at lower valuations. Major customer acquisition platforms are enabling            start-ups to disrupt traditional businesses. Finally, opportunities for investment            abound overseas in rapidly growing and emerging markets, in McClure's opinion. <span class="label">TN</span>            â©         </p></article>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/8077-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Core Curriculum Reading: Experimenting in the Entrepreneurial Venture</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Thomas R.

Entrepreneurs in these            startups translate their vision into business model hypotheses, then test the hypotheses            using a series of minimum viable products, each of which represents the smallest set of            features or activities needed to validate a concept. Founders of a lean startup also            know that time counts among their scarcest resources. Put simply: speed matters. Like            lean manufacturing, the lean startup method accelerates the tempo of innovation by using            rapid iteration, small batches, and short cycle times. The Reading begins by contrasting            the hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship approach with other methods. The Reading also            explains, step by step, how to formulate business model hypotheses, test them, and act            on the test feedback. In the final section, the Reading considers what settings are best            suited for hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship. The Reading also includes a section on            special topics, a glossary of key terms, and suggestions for complementary cases and            further reading. â©<span class="label">TN</span>         </p></article>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/8072-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Core Curriculum Reading:  Financing Entrepreneurial Ventures</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">William R.

It begins by examining how business models shape external            financing requirements. It then contrasts the choice to bootstrap with the option to            raise external funds, as well as the traits of debt versus equity investment. Students            learn about the different types of equity investors, including angels, VCs, and            strategic investors, and follow an entrepreneurial venture's path through the financing            stages. Students also examine how entrepreneurs can adjust business models to match            financial conditions, and how they can reduce financing needs through alternative models            such as partnerships. Finally, the Reading covers emerging funding models, such as            crowdsourcing and accelerators, and the global aspects of entrepreneurial finance. <span class="label">TN</span>            â©         </p></article>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/W14490-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">E-comics: Forecasting Demand</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Mala Srivastava; Gaurav Thaparâ©<br />         Ivey Publishing Caseâ© /          #W14490 (6 pages) /          Instructor Spreadsheet Available</p>      </p>  <p class="new-description">After spending a few years in the corporate world, in 2012 a young entrepreneur            in India decided to start up his own venture developing mobile applications that            supported interactive comic content. Called TodTales, the innovative e-comic would            incorporate music, interactive games, and augmented reality in a comic book format that            would encourage young children to read. He had raised the initial seed funding from his            own and his partner's personal resources and an angel investor. The prototype was ready            for demonstration and received positive responses from parents during a focus group            study conducted in Mumbai. With the hope of going commercial by the end of 2014, the            founder knew that he should start the next stage of development by convincing            prospective investors that his idea had commercial potential and would quickly find a            market not only in India but around the world. â©<span class="label">TN</span>         </p></article>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/815025-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Fast Ion Battery</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Ramana Nanda; Sid Misraâ©<br />         Harvard Business School Caseâ© /          #815025 (14 pages) </p>      </p>  <p class="new-description">John Davidson, a partner at Ware Street Capital and a board member at Fast Ion            Battery, was told by Don Lerner at Bluelock Ventures that Bluelock would not participate            in the $5 million bridge financing for Fast Ion Battery.

Decision trees and Monte            Carlo simulations are used to value these options, which make the opportunity look very            attractive. â©<span class="label">TN</span> â©         </p></article>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/215008-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Thomas Cook Group on the Brink</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Benjamin C.

The company has lost almost            Â£600 million in the past 3 quarters; has seen its stock price fall from 230 pence to a            low of 8.8 pence in the past 2 years; and has seen its bonds trade down to as little as            40% of face value. In just a few weeks the company's license to operate is to be            reviewed by the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority, competitors are publicly            questioning the company's viability, and seasonal working capital needs are about to            peak. With the company's very survival at stake, the CEO must devise a turnaround plan            that will return the company to financial health. Any plan must address the company's            high cost structure, raise substantial new capital, fix the balance sheet, create a            profitable growth strategy, and build a more effective organization and culture. But            achieving all these objectives within the short time available will be a major            challenge.â©         </p></article>   </section>   <hr class="featurette-divider" id="gm">   <section>      <h4>General Managementâ©</h4>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/E522-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Axel Springer in 2014: Strategic Leadership of the Digital Transformation</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Robert Burgelman; Robert Siegel;  Jason Lutherâ©<br />         Stanford Graduate School of Business Caseâ© /          #E522 (27 pages)  </p>      </p>  <p class="new-description">In 2013, Mathias Dopfner, CEO of the publishing house Axel Springer SE, a            premier source of content in Germany with its popular newspapers and magazines such as            Bild and Die Welt, was evaluating the progress of his company's digital transformation.            The advent of the digital revolution at the end of the 20th century had caused an            appreciable shift in the publishing industry: traditional print media players were            confronted with major technological advancements and changes in consumer tastes and how            news was consumed. â©<span class="label">TN</span>         </p></article>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/INS794-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Building the Virtual Lab: Global Licensing and Partnering at Merck</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Thomas Klueter; Felipe L.

Hospitals relied on profits            generated from the provision of medical services to cover the funding gap, while doctors            became kickback seekers to make up for their low rates. In traditional markets, global            pharmaceutical companies ("pharm companies") are no strangers to wooing hospitals and            doctors to favor the prescribing of their drugs. These questionable marketing practices            were taken to the next level in the China market. Streams of financial flows, legal or            not, from pharm companies to hospitals and doctors to win their favor in prescribing            their drugs became a structurally embedded problem of the country's health care system.            The Chinese government introduced a new round of reform in 2009. While it promises to            spend millions more on health care, its action to wipe out bribery and other            kickback-seeking behaviors of the industry left many players perplexed. <span class="label">TN</span>â©         </p></article>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/SPM51-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">HBO Boxing: Should Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. Fight on Cable or  Pay-Per-View?</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">George Foster; David Hoytâ©<br />         Stanford Graduate School of Business Caseâ© /          #SPM51 (40 pages)  </p>      </p>  <p class="new-description">Professional boxing was once a mainstream sport, but by the 2000s, it had            become a niche sport in the U.S. as few boxers were known beyond hardcore fans, top            fights were only available on premium cable or pay-per-view (PPV), and other combat            sports were on the rise. This case focuses on a decision facing HBO, one of the            important economic drivers of the sport. In September 2012, Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. lost            a title fight to Sergio Martinez. The fight was seen on HBO PPV. Most observers thought            that a rematch would attract a substantial PPV audience. However, Chavez would likely            also have an interim fight. HBO considered the possibility of having the interim Chavez            match on its cable channel rather than on PPV. This would make the fight available to            more viewers, hopefully increasing the audience for the PPV rematch with Martinez, and            would guarantee Chavez a sizable payment from television rights. However, if the fight            were on PPV, Chavez would have the opportunity to earn more money based on PPV sales. If            HBO believes it's in the long-term interest of the sport, the fighters, and HBO to have            the fight on cable rather than PPV, how can they convince Chavez to accept a lower            potential payday in exchange for an increased audience and the opportunity to build PPV            sales for the planned rematch with Martinez?â© <span class="label">TN</span>         </p></article>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/HK1041-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">IFCI: Turning Around an Ailing Financial Institution</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Shailendra Kumar Rai; C.P.

Non-performing assets ("NPAs") have            reached their peak, and the company does not have enough money to do business. It begins            selling off and renting out its premises to get money to sustain its operations, going            door to door to save itself. Employee morale is at its lowest level. IFCI's operations            become unsustainable and are no longer viable. Against this backdrop, the IFCI board of            directors and the government of India are in a quandary as they try to decide on IFCI's            future course. After evaluating all possible options, IFCI and the government decide to            restructure IFCI. IFCI's turnaround, which catapults it on the path to growth, includes            multiple factors such as converting debt into equity, creating provisions for bad loans,            restructuring liabilities, retiring high-cost debt, managing NPAs aggressively,            voluntarily retiring staff, focusing on short-term projects, adopting a selective            approach in identifying projects for assistance, and monitoring projects more            effectively. The most critical factor that enables the turnaround of the state financial            institution is the able leadership that not only changes IFCI's public sector culture            but also brings a new work culture and ethics to the organization. IFCI's turnaround            from the financial crisis inspires a lasting motivation in the hearts of its            employees. â©<span class="label">TN</span>         </p></article>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/R1409X-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Is It Ever OK to Break a Promise? </a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Neil Beardenâ©<br />         Harvard Business Review Case Discussionâ© /          #R1409X (4 pages) â© /          Commentary-Only Version #R1409Z â© /          Complete Case and Commentary #R1409L</p>      </p>  <p class="new-description">A student must decide whether to break his promise and leave the company that            sponsored his MBA when he is offered a dream job by a Silicon Valley start-up.

With all this, GE is            evolving its business model. â©         </p></article>                <article>           <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/HEC047-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Entrepreneurship and IT Complementarity: The Case  of People's Remittance and               Exchange Servicesâ©            </a></h5>            <p class="subtitle muted">Probir Kumar Banerjee;  Moez Limayem; Louis Maâ©<br />            HEC Montreal Case â© /             #HEC047 (17 pages)         </p>  <p class="new-description">Mr. Rao, with several years of banking experience, approached People's Group               Dubai, a venture capitalist firm, seeking financing for a micro-remittance-cum-foreign               exchange service operation in Hong Kong. He argued that demand for currency exchange               services in Hong Kong would continue to grow because of the high number of tourists who               visited Hong Kong on their China tour. He also argued that a captive market of domestic               workers who remitted their wages to their home countries would provide continuous demand               for  remittance services. Mr. Rao was confident that he could start quickly with a small               office staffed by a few tellers and one manager in a busy location of Hong Kong, and               then expand operations to other locations. However,  financing to cover fixed assets and               working capital would be required to open additional outlets. A major enabler of the               proposed strategy was the telecommunication network of  Western Union, which had               established a  presence in several parts of the world as a trustworthy provider of               remittance services. Mr. Rao also intended to benefit from the technology support and               expertise of the IT arm of People's Group based in Bangalore, India. People's Group               Dubai welcomed realistic entrepreneurial ideas if they were backed by clear strategies               for business growth and promised an acceptable rate of return on investment (ROI). With               competition and low-cost micro-remittance services provided by pure Internet players,               there were questions about the adequacy of technology support from the Bangalore arm in               steering Mr. Rao's proposed venture to success and generating adequate ROI in the short               and long run. People's Group directors debated the viability of the proposed               venture.â© <span class="label">TN</span>            </p>         </article>   </section>  <hr class="featurette-divider" id="ib">     <section>   <h4>International Businessâ©</h4>   <article>  <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/W14443-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Globalization of Hyatt Place</a></h5>   <p class="subtitle muted">Gevork Papiryanâ©<br />   Ivey Publishing Caseâ© /    #W14443 (11 pages)</p>  <p class="new-description">Multinational, multi-brand hotel corporations serve almost all segments of the   market.

In   March 2014, Tesco PLC (Tesco), the largest retailer in the U.K. and the 3rd-largest   supermarket group in the world, has signed an agreement with Trent Hypermarkets, the   retail division of the Tata Group, a leading Indian business conglomerate, for setting   up a 50:50 joint venture (JV) in Indian retail. Tesco is committed to investing Â£85   million (US$110 million) as its share of capital. As it gets down to the basics of   operating the JV, the management of Tesco, headquartered in London, United Kingdom, is   facing 3 major dilemmas: How should Tesco sustain the advantage of being the first   global multi-brand retailer to be allowed to invest in India? How should it fine-tune   its tried and tested global business model to suit Indian retail?

The company takes its corporate social responsibility (CSR) agenda seriously   and has developed a new standard for CSR in its supplier factories that is implemented   and audited by a nongovernmental organization. New challenges emerge as attention shifts   to the certification of production inputs such as wood. Although Western small- and   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face pressures to audit their suppliers in developing   countries, these SMEs often lack the financial and political resources to change   behaviors in supplier factories. The firm's quality manager must evaluate its   sustainability approach. How much leverage can a small company expect to have with its   suppliers? Furthermore, is the cost of auditing suppliers in a country such as Thailand   too high? <span class="label">TN</span>â©</p>   </article>   <article>  <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/R1409E-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Voices from the Front Lines</a></h5>   <p class="subtitle muted">Luc Minguet; Eduardo Caride;  Takeo Yamaguchi; Shane Tedjaratiâ©<br />   Harvard Business Review Articleâ© /    #R1409E (7 pages) â© / </p>  <p class="new-description">Executives on the front lines of managing across borders share their insights:   Luc Minguet, of France's Michelin, talks about the importance of cultural training not   just for managers taking on assignments abroad but also for local employees who work   with colleagues from around the world. He describes how his own experience learning to   communicate across cultures reflects the tire-maker's broader practices. Eduardo Caride,   of Madrid-based Telefonica, explains how the relatively young multinational corporation   is investing in a diverse talent mix as it strives to become a truly global company.   Whereas early on, leaders relied on exporting Spanish managers abroad, he notes the   street now runs both ways. Takeo Yamaguchi, of Japan's Hitachi, details his efforts to   create standardized global HR systems and processes across the conglomerate's 948   separate companies. "Three years ago we had no systematic way of tracking employees,   evaluating performance, or identifying future leaders," Yamaguchi says. "Today we do."   And Shane Tedjarati, from the U.S.'s Honeywell, talks about how the industrial   powerhouse is shifting its strategy toward new regions, such as China, India, Vietnam,   and Indonesia.

Sony Music's label, Columbia Records, with whom   Parkwood partnered on recorded-music activities, shared the costs&mdash;and therefore also the   risk&mdash;of the album, which had been 1.5 years in development and was a particularly   expensive proposition because of the many videos. How would fans and music industry   insiders react to the daring launch, unveiled via BeyoncÃ©'s Facebook and Instagram   accounts?

Originally focused on landscape and culture, the campaign   evolved to embrace such concepts as spiritual, medical, adventure, film, and sports   tourism on a year-round basis. In 2007, the campaign was extended to the international   arena with participation in events in Berlin, Cannes, London, and New York.

Culture generally provides the context for contract            language and shapes the parties' most basic assumptions regarding their respective            rights and responsibilities. Businesses must recognize, respect, and reconcile cultural            differences if they hope to contract successfully in the global environment. For U.S.            and Chinese businesses to better understand how to successfully negotiate and carry out            contractual relations with one another, they must recognize the differences in core            cultural values between the 2 countries and develop strategies for reconciling these            differences. Bridging these cultural differences adds value to business transactions and            minimizes the risk of failure. To help managers recognize and understand cultural            differences between the U.S. and China, this installment of Business Law &amp; Ethics            Corner focuses on 5 dimensions of the culture of the U.S. and China:            individualism/collectivism, universalism/particularism, power distance, context, and            direction. These aspects explain some of the major differences in viewing the law and            approaching contracts. To help managers navigate these cultural differences, this            article offers guidance on how to respect and reconcile cultural predispositions to            achieve true synergies. By bridging these cross-cultural differences between the U.S.            and China, managers can achieve the mutual expectations necessary to the long-term            success of cross-cultural business transactions.â©         </p></article>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/W14021-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Indian Steel Ltd: Tri-Party Negotiation&ndash;The Buyer (A)</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Samish Dalal; Agarwal Rajivâ©<br />         Ivey Publishing Caseâ© /          #W14021 (3 pages) â© /          B and C Cases Available </p>      </p>  <p class="new-description">This case presents a role play between a buyer, seller, and consultant.

Ambiguity            is an intrinsic aspect of strategic alliances and effective management of it determines            how well the partners are able to make the alliance work. Alliances are subject to 3            types of ambiguity&mdash;partner, interaction, and evaluative&mdash;that are important at different            stages of alliance evolution. Partner-related ambiguity is most prevalent at the            formation stage of the alliance, interaction ambiguity at the operational stage, and            evaluative ambiguity at the outcome stage. This article examines the mechanisms by which            firms can best manage these different types  of ambiguity to achieve a successful            alliance.â©         </p></article>   </section>    <hr class="featurette-divider" id="om">   <section>      <h4>Operations Managementâ©</h4>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/615013-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">AmazonFresh: Rekindling the Online Grocery Market</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Rory McDonald; Clayton M.

Netflix used Cinematch, its proprietary movie recommendation            software, to promote individually determined best-fit movies to customers. Hastings            determined that a 10% improvement to the Cinematch algorithm would decrease customer            churn and increase annual revenue by up to $89 million. However, traditional options for            improving the algorithm, such as hiring and training new employees, were time-intensive            and costly. Hastings decided to improve Netflix's software by crowdsourcing, and began            planning the Netflix Prize, an open contest searching for a 10% improvement on            Cinematch. The case examines the dilemmas Hastings faced as he planned the contest, such            as whether to use an existing crowdsourcing platform or create his own, what company            information to expose, how to protect customer privacy while making internal data sets            public, how to allocate IP, and how to manage the crowd.â©         </p></article>	    <!-- New!

Later, it expanded its offering to cover a broad spectrum of Internet            and mobile security products. In 2012, the company launched its own Internet search            engine called So.com. By August 2013, So.com captured 18% PC market share, and had posed            a threat to Baidu, China's largest and most established search engine provider. Yet to            compete against Baidu and other Chinese Internet giants in the long run, Qihoo needed to            find a way to replicate its PC market success in the mobile market.

The SMG division had not earned profits for the 22 years since its            inception, but was accommodated as part of the India operations of Bosch Limited as            other divisions cross-subsidized the division. However, after the restructuring, the            division became part of the global product division, which had no incentives to tolerate            the continuation of a loss-making division.

In late March 2014, Frozen became the highest-grossing animated feature,            worldwide, of all time. There was a period in the history of the 90- year-old studio,            not so many years ago (and prior to John Lasseter and Ed Catmull's leadership), when            Walt Disney Animation Studios had become more structured and hierarchical, and it wasn't            always easy to work across departments to innovate. Both high-tech computer animation            and creative storytelling was more cross-disciplinary and dynamic than ever.

A few years ago, HBS Professor Ethan Bernstein set out to find            empirical evidence that such approaches improve organizational performance. What he            discovered is that this kind of transparency often has an unintended consequence: it can            leave employees feeling vulnerable and exposed. When that happens, they conceal any            conduct that deviates from the norm so that they won't have to explain it. Unrehearsed,            experimental behaviors sometimes stop altogether. But Bernstein also discovered            organizations that had established zones of privacy within open environments by setting            4 types of boundaries: around teams, between feedback and evaluation, between decision            rights and improvement rights, and around periods of experimentation. Moreover, across            several studies, the companies that had done all this were the ones that consistently            got the most creative, efficient, and thoughtful work from their employees.            â©         </p></article>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/R1409D-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">What's Your Language Strategy?</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Tsedal Neeley; Robert Steven Kaplan â©<br />         Harvard Business Review Article â© /          #R1409D (8 pages) </p>      </p>  <p class="new-description">Language pervades every aspect of organizational life. Yet leaders of global            organizations&mdash;where unrestricted multilingualism can create friction&mdash;often pay too            little attention to it in their approach to talent management. By managing language            carefully, firms can hire and develop the best employees, improve collaboration on            global teams, and strengthen the company's footing in local markets. Language            proficiency&mdash;either in a lingua franca, or shared language, or in a local language&mdash;does            not guarantee high performance. Recruiters may favor fluency over other capabilities.            They may rely on external hires with language skills rather than grooming internal            candidates with the capacity and motivation to learn new languages. And leaders may give            expatriate assignments not to the best candidates but to people who speak certain            languages. To hire and promote the best people, firms may need to provide training to            meet global and local language needs.

As a result, EF China has been            very open, adaptive, and flexible to China's specific needs and culture, as well as            humble in not taking the credit for work they clearly contributed to and in many cases,            spearheaded. These strategies have led EF China to be very successful in helping to            develop and change energy policies; however, the case focuses on external changes and            how EF China is grappling with how to adapt its network strategy. â©<span class="label">TN</span>         </p></article>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/KEL801-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Innovation at One Acre Fund: Seeing the Forest for the Trees</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Jamie Jones; Grace Augustineâ©<br />         Kellogg School of Management Caseâ© /          #KEL801 (14 pages)  </p>      </p>  <p class="new-description">One Acre Fund (1AF) is a nonprofit organization in rural western Kenya that            helps farmers lift themselves out of poverty by providing a bundle of products and            services that support farmers with quality inputs, training on farming techniques,            access to credit, and assistance in achieving optimal prices. Since the organization's            founding nearly a decade ago, it has grown to serve over 180,000 farm families annually            as of July 2014. This high level of penetration into rural Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, and            Tanzania makes 1AF a potential distribution channel for rolling out new products and            technologies that could benefit farmers and their families. The organization prides            itself on its innovative culture, and always strives to offer new products and methods            to its farmers. In 2011, 1AF realized that it needed to formalize its innovation process            to ensure it was confident in new products before rolling them out across its entire            farmer network. It therefore created a robust, multistep evaluation framework to assess            new innovations on 4 criteria: impact, adoptability, simplicity, and            operability. â©<span class="label">TN</span>         </p></article>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/BAB271-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Made by Survivors: Business Solution for a Social Problem</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Gaurab Bhardwaj; Elizabeth Swanson Goldbergâ©<br />         Babson College Caseâ© /          #BAB271 (22 pages) </p>      </p>  <p class="new-description">The case tracks the creation and growth of a social enterprise, Made By            Survivors (MBS), founded by Sarah Symons and John Berger. Inspired by a documentary on            sex trafficking and a visit to a Nepalese nonprofit that helped women freed from sex            trafficking (survivors), Symons conceived the idea for a business that would help            survivors become financially independent and restore their lives. With Berger's help,            she launched MBS to sell handicrafts, stationery, and home goods in the U.S., all            products that were made by survivors in several countries, thus providing them a source            of income. To grow sales, the co-founders tried different means of selling, altering the            product mix, partnering with suppliers, starting production on their own, and designing            products to increase appeal to U.S. customers. The case ends with the co-founders            wondering how to multiply revenue to benefit greater numbers of survivors. Should they            modify their business model or adopt a new one? Should they modify their organization's            mission and identity? â© <span class="label">TN</span>         </p></article>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/BH619-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Using Social and Economic Incentives to Discourage Chinese Suppliers from Product            Adulterationâ©         </a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Christopher S.

Following a temporary drop in 2008,            both the number and retail value of recalled units have been increasing, despite various            efforts exerted by government agencies and private companies to combat this trend.            Currently, many countries&mdash;including China itself&mdash;are expressing serious concerns over            adulterated or unsafe food made or sold in China. What are the underlying reasons for            some Chinese suppliers to adulterate products? When law enforcement is still weak in            China, what can Western manufacturers do to reduce the risk of product adulteration? To            develop effective deterrence mechanisms, the authors first identify 4 underlying factors            that create incentives for some Chinese suppliers to produce unsafe products. Then,            ideas are proposed to discourage Chinese suppliers from producing adulterated products,            based on 2 underlying strategies.â©         </p></article>   </section>    <hr class="featurette-divider" id="strat">      <section>      <h4>Strategyâ©</h4>      <article>        <h5 class="title"><a href="http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/8105-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Core Curriculum Reading: Competitive Advantage</a></h5>         <p class="subtitle muted">Pankaj Ghemawat; Jan W.

These smart, connected products offer exponentially            expanding opportunities for new functionality, far greater reliability, and capabilities            that cut across and transcend traditional product boundaries. The changing nature of            products is disrupting value chains, argue Michael Porter and PTC CEO James Heppelmann,            and forcing companies to rethink nearly everything they do, from how they conceive,            design, and source their products to how they manufacture, operate, and service them to            how they build and secure the necessary IT infrastructure. Smart, connected products            raise a broad set of new strategic choices for companies about how value is created and            captured, how to work with traditional partners and what new partnerships will be            required, and how to secure competitive advantage as the new capabilities reshape            industry boundaries. â©         </p></article>    <!-- New!

MBIL was India's largest and the world's 3rd-largest optical            storage media manufacturer, with a presence in over 82 countries, serviced through            marketing offices in India, the U.S., and Europe.

But as it            encountered challenges it underwent several major strategy shifts, ultimately developing            a business model and an operational strategy that were highly disruptive to retail video            rental chains. The combination of a large national inventory, a recommendation system            that drove viewership across a broad catalog, and a large customer base made Netflix a            force to be reckoned with, especially as a distribution channel for lower-profile and            independent films. Blockbuster, the nation's largest retail video rental firm, was            initially slow to respond, but ultimately rolled out a hybrid retail/online response in            the form of Blockbuster Online. Aggressive pricing pulled in subscribers, though at a            price to both it and Netflix. But a new challenge was on the horizon: the rapid growth            of the company's online streaming service, which had a very different business model.            Hastings' efforts to separate the activity into 2 separate companies met with strong            pushback from consumers and the press.
